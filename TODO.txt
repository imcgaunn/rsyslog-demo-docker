Big Items Remaining for PoC:

- rsyslog configuration for app servers that will forward all messages
  from /var/log/app/app.log to a remote syslog server (one of the log nodes)

- rsyslog configuration for log nodes that will receive messages from tcp
  transport and send them along to postgres using the postgres output module

- settle on schema for log_events table - there's a draft in
  log-node/provisioning/roles/log-node/files/createschema.sql
